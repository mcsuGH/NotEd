# Task
NotEd is a solo project that I decided to create to help consolidate the learnings from working on my final team project at [Makers Academy (EdUp)](https://github.com/jmcnally17/EdUp). I will be attempting to recreate many features from this project and repurposing them to work for a notekeeping app instead, hence the name NotEd.\
\
In this app, users will be able to create notes which can be viewed with the most recent ones showing first, notes will be able to be removed to prevent clogging the view, there will be a maximum limit of notes for each user, there will be a premium user feature (and a payment system to allow this) which allows the premium users to check their old notes, there will be a interactive calendar system that users can use to mark events and possibly more.

# Instructions
Clone this repository to your desired location using `git clone https://github.com/mcsuGH/NotEd.git`.

# Features
TBA
